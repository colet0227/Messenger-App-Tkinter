This program features a messaging platform that allows users to text with other users on the DS platform. This platform supports saving and loading dsu profiles so users are capable of adding other users and exchanging messages with them. Added contacts and past conversations on dsu profiles are saved automatically. The use of a graphical user interface also allows for ease of navigation.

To run our program, you must first use the menu bar (outside of the interface at the top of the screen) in order to either open or create a new file. You must also use the settings dropdown in order to enter a username or password for the server (this can be an existing username with a valid password or a new username and password). Entering an existing username and password after creating a new file will load all previous recipients along with their sent messages.
(Editing a username and password is our flourish along with the toggle dark mode button.)

The Add User button is conveniently located in order to add a contact you wish to send messages to on the server; just enter the username. To send a message, you must click on the user you would like to send to and type in the text entry box in the bottom right of the interface. Once finished, you should press the send button and your message will send in addition to displaying on the screen.

The Toggle Dark Mode button located above the Add User button switched the display and text box from white to black along with the text inside.
